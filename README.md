Pyton code 
Write a Python program that will determine food costs for the KSU CCSE hackathon.
The hackathon will have pizza and salad option. The program should ask the number of
people who ordered pizza and the number of people who ordered a salad. Each person
who orders pizza is allocated three (3) slices of pizza. Each salad costs $7.99 per
person. Each pizza costs $15.99 and has 12 slices per pizza. Only whole pizzas can be
ordered.
If more than ten (10) pizzas are ordered, then there will be a 15% discount to the pizza
cost. If more than 10 salads are ordered there will be a 15% discount to the salad cost.
The delivery charge is 7% of the entire order prior to discounts or $20 minimum.
Display the number of each meals ordered (input is not considered as a display/output).
Determine and display the number of pizzas needed. Display the cost of the pizzaâ€™s
and display the cost of salads (before any discounts). Display the discount amount and
delivery charge. Finally display the total amount due. You do not need to round or
truncate your output.

Example of input
Number of pizza orders 43
Number of salad orders 7
Example of output
Pizza cost $175.89000000000001
Salad cost $55.93
Total $231.82000000000002
Discount $26.3835
